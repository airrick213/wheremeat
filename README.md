Where Me At
============

<strong>The Problem</strong><br>
If you have ever wanted to meet your friend, but you couldn't describe where you are, this app is perfect for you!<br>
With this app, you can send your location to your friend, and we will generate directions from his current location to you.

<strong>How This App Works</strong><br>
1. The map on the homepage centers on where you are (you can drag the marker to adjust it though).<br>
2. Make a map name and click Create.<br>
3. On the next page, enter his email and/or phone number and click Send.<br>
4. Your friend will now receive a message with a link to see directions from his current location to you! (He can also drag the markers to adjust his starting and end points).
